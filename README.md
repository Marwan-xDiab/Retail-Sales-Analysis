# Retail Data Analytics

* [Dashboar link Click Here](https://www.novypro.com/project/retail-sales-analysis)
> One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. Holidays and select major events come once a year, and so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line. In addition, markdowns are known to affect sales â€“ the challenge is to predict which departments will be affected and to what extent

## Data Sources
  - Stores
  - Features
  - Sales

## Overview During the project's completion, we went through the following stages: 
  - Data Manipulation (PowerQuery) 
  - Data modelling (galaxy schema) 
  - Explore the Data & Measure (Power BI)
  - Create a dashboard and extract meaningful information using DAX

## Dashboards :
  - Dashboard (Overview )
  - Dashboard ( Filter Tap) 
  - Dashboard (Sales Tree)
  - Dashboard (Sales Analysis)

## Some Recommendations:
  - On Christmas and Black Friday, sales every year increase suddenly, so we can display some products that sell less, and prepare the big stores for this crowd
  - 6/4/2012 There is a noticeable increase in sales this week, we have to find out the reason
  - At the beginning of the new year, sales are at the lowest level in all stores. This date can be used to arrange and reorganize stores
  - Since there aren't many C-type stores, we can open a lot of them as their sales grow over time.

> This dashboard may provide answers to all of these questions and more.

## Used technologies
  - Power BI
  - Dax
  - Data Modelling
  - PowerQuery.
